							In principle yes. But there are some limitations: The filetype has to be jpg or png. The max filesize is 1MB. The image will be resized to fit 320x480 pixels.

							At this time I only can guess that it has something to do with the app run time limit of 10 seconds which is set by palm. Try a smaller wallpaper and be sure to have a good internet connection. This should help.

							It is technically not possible to get the current wallpaper. So I can not realize to auto change the wallpaper on every update or to combine this app with existing wallpaper apps. To realize a Today screen the calendar data would have to be transfered to a server. I do not to transfer any private data anywhere so I will not realize that. It's a privacy issue!

							The update interval is set to a minimum of 1 hour because the app causes high traffic for my server. Example: if only 10000 users update every hour there will be an amount of about 500GB per month! In short: No it is not possible.
